# R for Everyone: Teaching Data and Coding Literacy Through Interactive R Lessons for Middle School Students

Welcome to my Data Science Capstone Project for Fall 2025. This project explores how we can make introductory programming and data science concepts **accessible, ethical, and engaging** for **middle school students (ages 11‚Äì14)**.

---

## Project Overview

This project builds a series of **interactive, beginner-friendly R lessons** using the `learnr` and/or `bookdown` packages. These lessons are designed to:
- Introduce coding and data analysis in a visual, intuitive way
- Use **real-world, fun datasets** (e.g., sports, weather, animals)
- Integrate **data ethics and justice** topics (privacy, consent, bias)
- Help students develop confidence, curiosity, and coding literacy

---

## Project Goals

Each interactive module will address a specific **Big Idea** from middle school data science education:

1. **Formulate a Statistical Investigative Question**
2. **Collect and Consider the Data**
3. **Analyze the Data**
4. **Interpret and Communicate the Results**

Additionally, the curriculum will introduce key **ethical themes**:
- We need permission to collect and analyze data about others.
- Confidentiality matters ‚Äî how can we maintain it?
- What is bias? Why is it important to avoid it, especially in data?

## Advanced Data Science Components

This capstone project demonstrates advanced methods through:
- **Interactive R programming** (`learnr`, `bookdown`, and/or `shiny`)
- **Data visualization** and live filtering of small real-world datasets
- **Computational data curation** (scraping, cleaning, simplifying)
- **User-focused design** to support novice learners
